Ok so:
 - all of this code is stolen from internet - i scarcely understand it. 
I have chosen 2 tutorials than look nice and copy pasted them into main.py and w3school.py.
They work almost fine because for some unknown to me and all deities reason there is a random black
rectangle on the final png. I dont know why and i dont really care.
- tictac.py is for now the file in which all of our program willoccur. I have downloaded the 
"originaltic-tac-toe-endgame.csv" and the data looks promising. I have tried to work with it using the same process
like in main.py but failed miserably and decided i dont care enough and then i went to bed.
I suggest however trying the second aproach - like in the w3school.py because there is a part about mapping, 
and it may be crucial for the project to work.
- From what i have seen most tutorials use the same libraries and functions so I think,
we should do the same because we have negative, time and at least I, negative will to do it.
- you will need some libraries - but I think you will figure it out by googling errors

So yeah: basically you have to work on tictac.py until you either die of get it done.

EDIT: 
Now the min focus is one the titanic.py as the tic-tac-toe's data turned out to be an awful experience
